1.  In your groups, make a codebook repository which will house a codebook for your final project

2.  **Chapter 1:** Using your pre-registration, add details on the background of the project, some broad strokes aims, and the data that will be in your cleaned dataset

3.  **Chapter 2:** Provide detailed information on constructs/variables in your mini-dataset (you can choose how you present this)

4.  **Chapter 3:** Provide some descriptive information on data cleaning re: inclusion/exclusion criteria

5.  In a 'scoring' folder, place a scoring script (and all other necessary files -- e.g. scoresheets) that you used to clean the data

6.  Make a 'data' folder and place the raw data here. If I run your scoring script above, it should output a cleaned dataset in the 'data' folder

7.  Render your codebook and publish it on GitHub pages

8.  Send me the link to your repo
